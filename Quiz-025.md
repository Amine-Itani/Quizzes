# Quiz 025
Errorbar graphs are more scientific than other graphs, allowing users to see figures while accounting for potential errors. To do this, the creator of the graph needs the mean and standard deviation on the data, which the numpy library can do very easily with it's mean and std functions. We append them to a list that we use to create the errorbar graph and the fill_between function with our maxes and minimums to give it a range to work in.

## Code

```py
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sensorA = [16, 24, 24, 9, 23, 26, 26, 23, 25, 14]
sensorB = [2, 19, 25, 10, 11, 24, 17, 7, 24, 17]
sensorC = [15, 11, 24, 21, 6, 2, 18, 27, 1, 16]

data = []
for v in range(len(sensorA)):
    data.append([int(sensorA[v]), int(sensorB[v]), int(sensorC[v])]) # turning into lists for numpy functions

x = [] # time in hours
t = 0
mean = [] # descriptive stats
std = [] # standard deviation
min_t = [] # minimum temperature
max_t = [] # maximum temperature
print(data)
for d in data:
    mean.append(np.mean(d)) # careful, np functions only work on lists
    std.append(np.std(d))
    min_t.append(np.min(d))
    max_t.append(np.max(d))
    x.append(t)
    t += 1

plt.errorbar(x, mean, std, fmt="o", color="#023047") # errorbar shows the given point +- the potential error as lines above and below the point
plt.fill_between(x, max_t, min_t, alpha=0.5, linewidth=0, color='#8ecae6') # fill between works kind of like a graph line, plotting all potential values while taking error into account
plt.xlabel("Time (hours)")
plt.ylabel("Temperature (C)")
plt.show()
```
